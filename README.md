Being The Machine
===============
This is the web based component of a larger project that guides a human in building something like a 3D printer. It takes gcode files as input and allows someone to visualize and customize their model for "printing" by hand. 

The physical portion of this project consists of an Arduino, pan-tilt bracket (made with servo motors), with a laser attached to the bracket. The link to "Download for Arduino" converts each gcode position, in order, to angle coordinates (represented in microseconds) so that the laser point essentially "draws" the G-Code instrcutures that are visualized in this interface. 

Links with more detailed descriptions of the workflow to come soon.
