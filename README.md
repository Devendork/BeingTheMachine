Being The Machine
===============
This is a version of the Being the Machine system that uses a mobile phone to serve instructions to the laser guide. Complete instructions for building the software and hardware components can be found at http://www.instructables.com/id/3D-Print-En-Plein-Air/

This repo includes code for the Arduino hardware as well as a cordova codebase for an accompnaying mobile app. So far, the app has only been tested on Android phones.
